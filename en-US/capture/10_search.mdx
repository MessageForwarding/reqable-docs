### Quick Filter

The quick filter is located at the top of the list and is divided into three parts: protocol, content type, and status code. Filter items in different parts can coexist, and the logical relationship is `and`. Click each filter item to quickly filter, and click again to cancel the filter.

There are two types of input for filtering content: text input and selection input. Text input supports case matching and regular expressions. Selection input, just click the input box and select from the pop-up menu. Some types of text input will have content prompts, such as request type, server address, etc.

When the traffic of multiple devices is displayed in the list, you can use `Local Address` to search and filter, for example `127.0.0.1` means the current computer.
