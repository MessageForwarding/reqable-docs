The quick bar is the control center, integrates such as SSL certificate, proxy, turbo mode, incognito mode, script, breakpoint, rewrite, mirror and gateway. For example, tap the network icon can automatically configure the system proxy or close the system proxy, and right-clicking can config the proxy protocol.
